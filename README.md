# scratch-blocks
## Instructions

```
npm install
npm link
```

Because I have not found the way to fix the automatically generat file, after build.py generat  these language compressed file.We need to add these code to the file by hand.

```js
// Do not edit this file; automatically generated by build.py.
'use strict';

let Blockly = require('scratch-blocks');

// Hide some code content

module.exports = Blockly.Arduino;
```
